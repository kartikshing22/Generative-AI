**1. Haiku (Nature)**
Whispers in the breeze,
autumn leaves kiss the still earth—
time folds into gold.

**2. Motivational**
Rise with the morning,
chase what the night could not hold.
Dreams wait for the bold.

**3. Romantic**
Your smile is a flame,
lighting shadows in my chest—
home lives in your eyes.

**4. Reflective**
Between silence, breath,
a thousand worlds bloom and fade,
yet the soul remains.


**1. Free Verse (Hope & Resilience)**
The night may stretch endlessly,
its silence heavy,
its stars too far to touch.
But morning always remembers us—
with sun-warmed hands,
it pulls us gently
out of our shadows.
Every wound softens in daylight.
Every broken road
still leads somewhere.

**2. Sonnet (Love)**
Upon your voice my restless spirit leans,
A melody that steadies storms within.
No fleeting doubt, nor time’s relentless means,
Could dim the light where your true love has been.
Your presence bends the silence into song,
And every glance writes poems in the air.
The heart insists it always did belong—
It found its home the moment you were there.
So let the years be ink upon our page,
Each line a vow that deepens as we grow.
Though seasons change, and youth must turn to age,
The root remains, no matter winds that blow.
For love, once lit, defies the dark of years,
A flame that burns through laughter, pain, and tears.

**3. Narrative Poem (Journey)**
A boy once set upon a road,
with nothing but a pack,
a whisper of dreams in his chest.

He crossed forests where silence grew heavy,
rivers that asked for courage,
mountains that tested the marrow of his bones.

Every step was both an ending and a beginning.
Every fall carved wisdom into his skin.

At last, he stood on a hill of morning,
the world spread before him,
not conquered, but understood.
And he knew:
the journey was not to find the world—
but to find himself.


### 1. Haiku

River bends gently,
mountains cradle morning mist—
earth breathes in silence.

### 2. Free Verse

The forest does not hurry.
Every root remembers,
every stone waits
for rain to return.
Even the wind moves softly,
teaching us patience—
a language older than words.

### 3. Lyrical Poem

The moon leans low upon the lake,
her silver hand a trembling wake.
The owls rehearse their midnight song,
while shadows stretch the stars along.
And in this vast, unspoken choir,
the heart learns how to dream entire.

### 4. Narrative Poem

A seed fell once upon the ground,
forgotten by the world.
No gardener’s hand, no tender care,
no promise to unfold.

And yet the rain remembered it,
the sun leaned close with fire,
the soil embraced its fragile form,
the sky drew it up higher.

From root to stem, from leaf to tree,
a forest grew from one—
a testament that even small
beginnings are not done.

### 5. Closing Reflection (Short Verse)

We are only guests
in this vast and living home.
May our footsteps heal.
